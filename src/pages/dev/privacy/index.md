Jakub Roman ("I") operates a handful of temporary apps and websites used for development and testing purposes 
("Services"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information 
I receive from users of those Services ("Developer Privacy Policy").

By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use 

While using Services, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to 
contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal 
Information").

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update or change the Developer Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Development
Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of Services after I post any modifications to the Development Privacy 
Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by 
the modified Developer Privacy Policy.
